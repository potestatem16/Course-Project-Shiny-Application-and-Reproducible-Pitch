## BMI App
This application tries to provide a quick method to know the BMI index, to which our characteristics of weight and height belong.

## Method

The method used to obtain the BMI index is: 
$$ BMI = \frac{Weight}{Height^2}$$ 

```{r}
h <- 180
w <- 80
(BMI <- 80/((180/100)^2))
```


## Contraindications.
BMI is not used for muscle builders, long distance athletes, pregnant women, the elderly or young children.
